# Lesson 13 in Patrick's course

In this project we deposit, take a loan and repay to Aave with a script

- dev dependencies to install when you create a new hardhat project are in the github chapter 9.

- Mainnet fork is very simple :) just add the right configuration in the `hardhat.config.js` file, the Mainnet rpc endpoint in the `env` file and you are good to go.

- The deploy folder contains code to deploy your smart contracts. The scripts and tags folder normally contains code to interact with your contracts.

- To interact with DeFi you need the ABI and the contract address... and read the documentation. With that and a good script you can interact programatically with DeFi.
